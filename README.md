Student List Pagination

The Student List Pagination project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was built to start my journey of learning full stack web development and to improve upon my skillset as a front end developer.

When the document is first loaded it displays numbered buttons located on the bottom of the page, it also displays nine out of fifty-four students, with their name, email address, and picture. Whenever a user clicks on any of the numbered buttons it will display a different set of nine students. The functionality of having the buttons display a different set of students (when clicked) enables the user to have a better user experience compared to scrolling down the page to look through all people on the page.

Some of the early problems encountered, was trying to determine how to add the functionality of displaying a different set of people and resolving a bug when the a user clicks around the numbered buttons. The bug displayed the entire list of students as opposed to display nine students. A feature to implement in the future is to add a search field, which users can filter all of the students and find a specific person(s). Thus improving upon the user experience.
